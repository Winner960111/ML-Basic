In this lesson, we will walk through the major milestones of the history of Machine Learning and AI.

The history of Artificial Intelligence as a field is intertwined with the history of Machine Learning, as the algorithms and computational advances that underpin ML fed into the development of AI. It is useful to remember that, while these fields as distinct areas of inquiry began to crystallize in the 1950s, important [algorithmical, statistical, mathematical, computational and technical discoveries](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_machine_learning) predated and overlapped this era. 

## Notable Discoveries

- 1763, 1812 [Bayes Theorem](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) and its predecessors. This theorem and its applications underlie inference, describing the probability of an event occuring based on prior knowledge. 
- 1805 [Least Square Theory](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares) by French mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre. This theory, which you will learn about  in our Regression unit, helps in data fitting. 
- 1913 [Markov Chains](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) named after Russian mathematician Andrey Markov is used to describe a sequence of possible events based on a previous state.
- 1957 [Perceptron](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) is a type of linear classifier invented by American psychologist Frank Rosenblatt that underlies advances in deep learning. 
- 1967 [Nearest Neighbor](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor) is an algorithm originally designed to map routes. In an ML context it is used to  detect patterns.
- 1970 [Backpropagation](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) is used to train [feedforward neural networks](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) 
- 1982 [Recurrent Neural Network](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) are artificial neural networks derived from feedforward neural networks that create temporal graphs.

âœ… Do a little research. What other dates stand out as pivotal in the history of ML and AI?

## 1950: Machines that Think

Alan Turing, a truly remarkable person who was voted [by the public in 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icons:_The_Greatest_Person_of_the_20th_Century) as the greatest scientist of the 20th century, is credited as helping to lay the foundation for the concept of a 'machine that can think'.

## 1956: Dartmouth Research Project

"To proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it -- John McCarthy" 

They named the field of "Artificial Intelligence". This is the first time the phrase was coined.

## 1956 - 1974: "The Gold Rush"

Optimism was high in this era that AI could solve many problems. Research was very well funded. Shakey the robot could maneuver and  decide. Eliza could converse w/ ppl. Blocksworld

## 1974 - 1980: "AI Winter"

Funding stopped, optimism lowered. Some issues included:
compute power was too limited
combinatorial explosion: the amount of parameters needing  to be trained exploded w/o compute keeping up
paucity of data, hindered the process of using algorithms
how to frame the question...were we asking the right questions, were they specific enough
lots of criticism about approaches
    criticism on turing tests
    chinese room theory
    ethical criticism of eliza

scruffy vs. neat AI
neat AI has lots of trees and logical reasoning
scruffy AI encompasses an idea's metadata -led  to progressions in OO programming

## 1980s Expert systems

knowledge became the focus of AI and its businenss impact became acknowledged

revival of connectionism (NN) behind the scenes, in research
hopfield net
backpropagation
applied neural networks

## 1987 - 1993: AI Chill
hardware had become too specialized
moving into an era of personal computers  - computing becoming democratized

## 1990s: AI based on Robotics

To show real intelligence AI needs a body

## 1993 - 2011

Same issues start to be solved
excessive data
huge compute power
more powerful algorithms
better able to frame question

## Now

AI started as a single area, now there are many parts and they cross-collaborate
