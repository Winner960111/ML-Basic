# Build an API to use your saved model

In this section of the curriculum, you will be introduced to an applied ML topic: how to save your Scikit-Learn model as a file that can be used to make predictions by means of an API. An API (Application Programming Interface) is software that forms the handshake between your backend (in our case, the ML model) and a frontend of your choice. In this lesson, let's build an API to query two different types of models.
