# Getting Started with Natural Language Processing 

In this section of the curriculum, you will be introduced to one of the most widespread uses of machine learning: Natural Language Processing. Derived from Computational Linguistics, NLP informs models that you use every day to communicate via voice and text with machines. In these lessons we'll learn the basics of NLP by building small conversational bots to learn how Machine Learning aids in making these conversations more and more 'smart'. You'll travel back in time, chatting with Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy from Jane Austen's classic novel, **Pride and Prejudice**, published in 1813. Then, you'll further your knowledge by learning about sentiment analysis via hotel reviews in Europe.
