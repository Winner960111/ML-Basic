# Machine Learning for Beginners - A Curriculum

> üåç Travel around the world as we explore Machine Learning by means of world cultures üåç

Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are pleased to offer a 12-week, 24-lesson curriculum all about traditional Machine Learning. In this lesson group, you will learn about what is sometimes called 'classic' ML, using primarily Scikit-Learn as a library and avoiding deep learning, which is covered in our forthcoming 'AI for Beginners' curriculum. 

Travel with us around the world as we apply these classic techniques to data from many areas of the world. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, written instructions to complete the lesson, a solution, an assignment and more. Our project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.

**Hearty thanks to our authors (list all authors here)**

 **üôèSpecial thanksüôè to our Microsoft Student Ambassador Reviewers**, notably Rishit Dagli, Rohan Raj, Muhammad Sakid Khan, Alexandru Petrescu, Abhishek Jaiswal, Nawrin Tabassum, Ioan Samuila, and Snigdha Agarwal

**Teachers**, we have [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum. If you would like to create your own lessons, we have also included a [lesson template](lesson-template/README.md)

**Students**, to use this curriculum on your own, fork the entire repo and complete the exercises on your own:

- Start with a pre-lecture quiz
- Read the lecture and complete the activities, pausing and reflecting at each knowledge check. 
- Try to create the projects by comprehending the lessons rather than running the solution code; however that code is available in the `/solution` folders in each project-oriented lesson. 
- Take the post-lecture quiz
- Complete the challenge
- Complete the assignment
- Consider forming a study group with friends and go through the content together. 
- For further study, we recommend following [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com?WT.mc_id=academic-15963-cxa) modules and learning paths.

## Pedagogy

We have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is hands-on **project-based** and that it includes **frequent quizzes**. In addition, this curriculum has a common **theme** to give it cohesion.

By ensuring that the content aligns with projects, the process is made more engaging for students and retention of concepts will be augmented. In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 12 week cycle.

> Find our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We welcome your constructive feedback!

## Each lesson includes:

- optional sketchnote
- optional supplemental video
- pre-lesson warmup quiz
- written lesson
- for project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- knowledge checks
- a challenge
- supplemental reading
- assignment
- post-lesson quiz

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are contained [in this app](https://jolly-sea-0a877260f.azurestaticapps.net), for 48 total quizzes of three questions each. They are linked from within the lessons but the quiz app can be run locally; follow the instruction in the `quiz-app` folder.
