In this case, we will precisely know the state size, because it will depend on the number of bins we select for digitalization.\n",

For example, in our case 2 out of 4 values do not have upper/lower bounds on their values, which may result in the infinite number of states.\n",

    "We have now learnt how to train agents to achieve good results just by providing them a reward function that defines the desired state of the game, and by giving it an opportinity to intellegently explore the search space. We have successfully applied Q-Learning algorithm in the cases of discrete and continuous environments, but with discrete actions. In the are of reinforcement learning, we need to further study situations where action state is also continuous, and when observation space is much more complex, such as the image from Atarti game screen. In those problems we often need to use more powerful machine learning techniques, such as neural networks, in order to achieve good results. Those more advanced topics are the subject of more advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning course."
