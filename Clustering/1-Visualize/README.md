Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that presumes that a dataset is unlabelled. It uses various algorithms to sort through unlabeled data and provide groupings according to patterns it discerns in the data. Clustering is very useful for data exploration. Let's see if it can help discover trends and patterns in the way Nigerian audiences consume music.

âœ… Take a minute to think about the uses of clustering. In real life, clustering happens whenever you have a pile of laundry and need to sort out your family members' clothes ðŸ§¦ðŸ‘•ðŸ‘–ðŸ©². In data science, clustering happens when trying to analyze a user's preferences, or determine the characteristics of any unlabeled dataset. Clustering, in a way, helps make sense of chaos.
### Introduction

[Scikit-Learn offers a large array](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html) of methods to perform clustering. The type you choose will depend on your use case. According to the documentation, each method has various benefits. Here is a simplified table of the methods supported by Scikit-Learn and their appropriate use cases:

| Method name                  | Use case                                                               |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| K-Means                      | general purpose, inductive                                             |
| Affinity propagation         | many, uneven clusters, inductive                                       |
| Mean-shift                   | many, uneven clusters, inductive                                       |
| Spectral clustering          | few, even clusters, transductive                                       |
| Ward hierarchical clustering | many, constrained clusters, transductive                               |
| Agglomerative clustering     | many, constrained, non Euclidan distances, transductive                |
| DBSCAN                       | non-flat geometry, uneven clusters, transductive                       |
| OPTICS                       | non-flat geometry, uneven clusters with variable density, transductive |
| Gaussian mixtures            | flat geometry, inductive                                               |
| BIRCH                        | large dataset with outliers, inductive                                 |

> ðŸŽ“ Let's unpack some vocabulary:
>
> - 'transductive' vs. 'inductive'
>  - 'non-flat' vs. 'flat' geometry
>  - 'distances'
>  - 'constrained'
>  - 'density'
