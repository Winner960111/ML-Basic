# Build a Web App to use your ML Model

In this section of the curriculum, you will be introduced to an applied ML topic: how to save your Scikit-Learn model as a file that can be used to make predictions within a web application. Once the model is saved, you'll learn how to use it in a web app built in Flask. You'll first create a model using some data that's all about UFO sightings! Then, you'll build a web app that will allow you to input a number of seconds with a latitude and a longitude value to predict which country reported seeing a UFO.
