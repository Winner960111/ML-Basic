Scikit-Learn offers a similar, but more granular cheat sheet that can further help narrow down your estimators (another term for classifiers):

This map is very helpful as you can 'walk' along its paths to a decision:

- We have >50 samples
- We want to predict a category

- We can choose a Linear SVC
- If that doesn't work, since we have numeric data
- We can try a KNeighbors Classifier and if that doesn't work, try SVC and Ensemble Classifiers

This is a terrific trail to try. For our first foray, explore how well
