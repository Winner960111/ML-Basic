        "Classification is a form of [supervised learning](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) that bears a lot in common with regression techniques. In classification, you train a model to predict which `category` an item belongs to. If machine learning is all about predicting values or names to things by using datasets, then classification generally falls into two groups: *binary classification* and *multiclass classification*.\n",

        "\n",
        "-   **Linear regression** helped you predict relationships between variables and make accurate predictions on where a new datapoint would fall in relationship to that line. So, you could predict a numeric values such as *what price a pumpkin would be in September vs. December*, for example.\n",
