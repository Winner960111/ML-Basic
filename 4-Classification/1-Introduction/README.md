# Introduction to Classification

In these four lessons, you will discover the 'meat and potatoes' of classic machine learning - Classification. No pun intended - we will walk through using various classification algorithms with a dataset all about the brilliant cuisines of Asia. Hope you're hungry!

Classification is a form of [supervised learning](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) that bears a lot in common with Regression techniques. If machine learning is all about assigning names to things via datasets, then classification generally falls into two groups: binary classification and multiclass classfication.

Remember, Linear Regression helped you predict relationships between variables and make accurate predictions on where a new datapoint would fall in relationship to that line. So, you could predict what price a pumpkin would be in September vs. December, for example. Logistic Regression helped you discover binary categories: at this price point, is this pumpkin orange or not-orange?

Classification uses various algorithms to determine other ways of determining a data point's label or class. Let's work with this recipe data to see whether, by observing a group of ingredients, we can determine its cuisine of origin.
