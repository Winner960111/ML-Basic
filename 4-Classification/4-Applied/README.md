# Build a Cuisine Recommender Web App

In this lesson, you will build a classification model using some of the techniques you have learned in previous lessons and with the delicious cuisine dataset used throughout this series. In addition, you will build a small web app to use a saved model, leveraging Onnx's web runtime.

One of the most useful practical uses of machine learning is building recommendation systems, and you can take the first step in that direction today!
