# Logistic Regression to Predict Categories

> Sketchnote on Logistic Regression
## [Pre-lecture quiz](https://jolly-sea-0a877260f.azurestaticapps.net/quiz/11/)

### Introduction

In this final lesson on Regression, one of the basic 'classic' ML techniques, we will take a look at Logistic Regression. You would use this technique to discover patterns to predict categories. 

In this lesson, you will learn:
- A new library for data visualization
- Techniques for Logistic Regression
## Prerequisite

Having worked with the pumpkin data, we are now familiar enough with it to realize that there's one small category that we can work with: Color. Let's build a Logistic Regression model to predict that, given a pumpkin's size, what color it will be (orange or white). There is also a 'striped' category in our dataset but there are few instances, so we will not use it.

> ðŸŽƒ Fun fact, we sometimes call white pumpkins 'ghost' pumpkins. They aren't very easy to carve, so they aren't as popular as the orange ones but they are cool looking!
### Preparation

We have loaded up the [starter notebook](./notebook.ipynb) with pumpkin data once again and cleaned it so as to preserve a dataset containing Color and Item Size.
