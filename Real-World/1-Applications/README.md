# Machine Learning in the Real World

In this curriculum, you have learned many ways to prepare data for training and create machine learning models. You built a series of classic Regression, Clustering, Classification, Natural Language Processing, and Time Series models. Congratulations! Now, you might be wondering what it's all for...what are the real world applications for these models?

While a lot of interest in industry has been garnered by AI, which usually leverages Deep Learning, there are still valuable applications for classical machine learning models, some of which you use today, although you might not be aware of it. In this lesson, you'll explore how ten different industries and subject-matter domains use these types of models to make their applications more performant, reliable, intelligent, and thus more valuable to users.

## Finance

One of the major consumers of classical machine learning models is the finance industry. Two specific examples we cover here are **credit card fraud detection** and **wealth management**. 

### Credit card fraud detection

We learned about [k-means clustering](Clustering/2-K-Means/README.md) earlier in the course, but how can it be used to solve problems related to credit card fraud?

K-means clustering comes in handy during a credit card fraud detection technique called **outlier detection**. Outliers, or deviations in observations about a set of data, can tell us if a credit card is being used in a normal capacity, or if something funky is going on. As shown in [this paper](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.680.1195&rep=rep1&type=pdf), you can sort credit card data using a k-means clustering algorithm and assign each transaction to a cluster based on how much of an outlier it appears to be. Then, you can evaluate for riskiest cluster for fraudulent versus legitimate transactions.

### Wealth management

In wealth management, an individual or firm handles investments on behalf of their clients. Their job is to sustain and grow wealth in the long-term, so it is essential to choose investments that perform well.

One way to evaluate how a particular investment performs is through statistical regression. [Linear regression](Regression/1-Tools/README.md) is a valuable tool for understanding how a fund performs relative to some benchmark. We can also deduce whether or not the results of the regression are statistically significant, or how much they would affect a client's investments. You could even further expand your analysis using multiple regression, where additional risk factors can be taken into account. For an example of how this would work for a specific fund, check out [this paper](http://www.brightwoodventures.com/evaluating-fund-performance-using-regression/) on evaluating fund performance using regression.
