## Review & Self Study

Take a look at Stanford's K-Means Simulator [here](https://stanford.edu/class/engr108/visualizations/kmeans/kmeans.html). You can use this tool to visualize sample data points and determine its centroids. With fresh data, click 'update' to see how long it takes to find convergence. You can edit the data's randomness, numbers of clusters and numbers of centroids. Does this help you get an idea of how the data can be grouped?
