        "[K-Means Clustering](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) is a method derived from the domain of signal processing. It is used to divide and partition groups of data into `k clusters` based on similarities in their features.\n",
        "\n",
        "The clusters can be visualized as [Voronoi diagrams](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram), which include a point (or 'seed') and its corresponding region.\n",

        "K-Means clustering has the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  The data scientist starts by specifying the desired number of clusters to be created.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Next, the algorithm randomly selects K observations from the data set to serve as the initial centers for the clusters (i.e., centroids).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Next, each of the remaining observations is assigned to its closest centroid.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Next, the new means of each cluster is computed and the centroid is moved to the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  Now that the centers have been recalculated, every observation is checked again to see if it might be closer to a different cluster. All the objects are reassigned again using the updated cluster means. The cluster assignment and centroid update steps are iteratively repeated until the cluster assignments stop changing (i.e., when convergence is achieved). Typically, the algorithm terminates when each new iteration results in negligible movement of centroids and the clusters become static.\n",
        "\n",
        "<div>\n",
        "\n",
        "> Note that due to randomization of the initial k observations used as the starting centroids, we can get slightly different results each time we apply the procedure. For this reason, most algorithms use several *random starts* and choose the iteration with the lowest WCSS. As such, it is strongly recommended to always run K-Means with several values of *nstart* to avoid an *undesirable local optimum.*\n",
